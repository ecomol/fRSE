# fRSE
fRSE is an R package for estimating the number of ALL rare species in an additional ecological sample. The methods we used include a highly accurate Bayesian-weighted estimator and two unweighted estimators.

Note that the difference between fRSE and RSE packages is that RSE package estimates the number of newly found rare species in the additional sample. That is, the estimated rare species have been recorded in the original sample. By contrast, the fRSE package is to predict the number of total rare species in the additional sample. This means, the estimated value is the sum of newly found rare species and those species that have been previously observed in the original sample but will become rare in the additional sample.  For the latter species, they can be either rare or common the original sample.
